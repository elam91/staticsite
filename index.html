    <p id="mainsong">You ran away to find something to say<br> I went astray to make it okay<br> And he made it easy,
        darlin'<br>
        I'm still in love, and I say that because<br> I know how it seems between you and me<br> It hasn't been easy,
        darlin'
        <br>
        <br> I can't even look at you<br> Would you look at the space just next to your feet?<br> The wood is warping
        <br> The lines distorting<br> This house is on fire, woo!<br> Burning the tears right off my face<br> What the
        hell did we re, woo!<br> Burning the tears right off my face<br> What the hell did we do?<br> Tell me we'll make
        it through<br>
        <br> 'Cause he made it easy, easy<br> Please, don't leave me, leave me (Easy)<br>

        <br> What's left of the dance?<br> The smell on my hands<br> The rock in my throat, a hair on my coat<br> The
        stranger at home, my darling<br> (Like some kind of freak, my darling)<br> Now I'm vulnerable, so sad and alone
        <br> But don't cry for me, 'cause everyone knows<br> You reap what you sow, my darling<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>

        <br> I can't even look at you<br> Would you look at the space just next to your feet?<br> The wood is warping
        <br> The lines distorting<br> This house is on fire, woo!<br> Burning the tears right off my face<br> What the
        hell did we do?<br> Tell me we'll make it through</p>
